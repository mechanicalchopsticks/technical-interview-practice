# Technical Interview Practice

A collection of Software Engineer practice problems with test suites, designed to be generated and extended with Codex.

---

## Design Principles
- It should be easy to get AI to add new practice problems that can (1) be tested under the existing framework and (2) be searcheable by opening index.html
- It should be easy to find relevant practice problems to work on
- SWEs practice should be able to run tests against their practice problem answer files without having to update any code besides the code in their answer file
- Tests should isolated and not bleed data
- Practice problem logic should be cumalitive; later stage logic should utilize earlier stage logic where possible
- Practice problems should be strive to realistic represent practice problems an SWE might encounter in a real technical interview
- This repo is meant to be used locally

## Repo structure
More directories may be added over time as problems in different languages are added, but the overall structure should stay the same.

```
index.html                    # Searchable problem browser — open in any browser locally
data.js                       # Problems array holding meta-data about all practice problems
python/
  practice_problems/          # Problem stubs — read these, don't edit them
  practice_problem_answers/   # Your implementations go here
  tests/                      # pytest suites (one per problem)
  conftest.py                 # pytest config & --answer flag
react/
  practice_problems/          # React/JSX/TSX starter files
  practice_problem_answers/   # Isolated answer directories, each with App.jsx or App.tsx
  src/App.jsx                 # Permanent placeholder (never edit during practice)
  src/main.jsx                # Vite entry point (do not modify)
  tests/                      # Playwright e2e specs (one per problem)
  package.json                # Vite + Playwright deps
  playwright.config.js        # Playwright config (auto-starts Vite)
  vite.config.js
typescript/
  practice_problems/          # .ts class stubs (read-only during practice)
  practice_problem_answers/   # Your implementations go here
  tests/                      # Jest suites (one per problem)
  package.json                # Jest + ts-jest deps
  jest.config.js              # Answer-redirect plugin
golang/
  practice_problems/          # problem_NN_<name>/ dirs, each with problem.go + problem_test.go
  practice_problem_answers/   # cw_answer_NN_<name>.go files
  go.mod
run_tests.sh                  # Unified test runner for all languages (see below)
AGENTS.md                     # Canonical repository-wide Codex guidance
CLAUDE.md                     # Lightweight Claude Code compatibility pointer
```

## Prerequisites

### Python (one-time setup)

```bash
# From the repo root
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install pytest
```

`run_tests.sh` activates `.venv` automatically, so you don't need to do it manually before running tests.

### React (one-time setup)

```bash
cd react
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # download the test browser (~95 MB)
```

### TypeScript (one-time setup)

```bash
cd typescript
npm install
```

### Go (one-time setup)

Go 1.22 or newer must be installed. Check with:

```bash
go version
```

No additional dependencies — all Go problems use only the standard library.

---

## Browsing problems

Open `index.html` in any browser (double-click it in Finder, or run `open index.html`).

The index lets you filter by language and industry, search by keyword, and click tags to narrow results. Each card has an **Open in VS Code** link that deep-links directly into your local clone — no path configuration needed.

---

## Practicing a problem

### 1. Find a problem

Browse `index.html` to pick something, then click **Open in VS Code** to open the stub.

---

### Python problems

#### 2. Copy the stub to your answers directory

```bash
cp python/practice_problems/problem_03_permission_manager.py \
   python/practice_problem_answers/my_answer_03_permission_manager.py
```

The prefix (`my_answer_`, `cw_answer_`, etc.) can be anything — the filename **must** keep the `NN_<name>` segment (e.g. `03_permission_manager`) so the runner can map it to the right test suite.

#### 3. Implement it

Fill in the `raise NotImplementedError` stubs. Keep the function/class signatures identical to the stub.

#### 4. Run tests against your answer

```bash
# Full test suite
./run_tests.sh \
  -f python/practice_problem_answers/my_answer_03_permission_manager.py \
  -c pytest python/tests/test_problem_03_permission_manager.py -v

# Single test class
./run_tests.sh \
  -f python/practice_problem_answers/my_answer_03_permission_manager.py \
  -c pytest python/tests/test_problem_03_permission_manager.py::TestCreateRole

# Single test method
./run_tests.sh \
  -f python/practice_problem_answers/my_answer_03_permission_manager.py \
  -c pytest python/tests/test_problem_03_permission_manager.py::TestCreateRole::test_empty_permissions_by_default

# Stop on first failure
./run_tests.sh \
  -f python/practice_problem_answers/my_answer_03_permission_manager.py \
  -c pytest python/tests/test_problem_03_permission_manager.py -x
```

`--answer` is injected automatically — you never need to edit the test files.

---

### React problems

#### 2. Create your answer directory and copy the stub into it

```bash
mkdir -p react/practice_problem_answers/cw_answer_02_incident_dashboard
cp react/practice_problems/problem_02_incident_dashboard.jsx \
   react/practice_problem_answers/cw_answer_02_incident_dashboard/App.jsx
```

`react/src/App.jsx` is a permanent placeholder — never edit it.
Your answer lives in its own isolated directory.

#### 3. Implement it in a browser

```bash
cd react
PRACTICE_ANSWER=practice_problem_answers/cw_answer_02_incident_dashboard npm run dev
```

Opens http://localhost:5173 and hot-reloads your `App.jsx` on every save.
You can add helper files (components, hooks, etc.) inside your answer directory
and import them normally.

#### 4. Run Playwright tests against your answer

Use `run_tests.sh` the same way as Python — pass the answer directory (or `App.jsx` inside it):

```bash
# Run the Playwright suite for problem 02
./run_tests.sh \
  -f react/practice_problem_answers/cw_answer_02_incident_dashboard \
  -c npm run test:02

# Open Playwright's interactive UI (step through each test visually)
./run_tests.sh \
  -f react/practice_problem_answers/cw_answer_02_incident_dashboard \
  -c npm run test:ui
```

Or run directly from the `react/` directory:

```bash
cd react
PRACTICE_ANSWER=practice_problem_answers/cw_answer_02_incident_dashboard npm run test:02
PRACTICE_ANSWER=practice_problem_answers/cw_answer_02_incident_dashboard npm run test:ui
```

Stop any running `npm run dev` session before running tests — when `PRACTICE_ANSWER`
is set, Playwright always spawns a fresh dev server to ensure it uses the right answer.

#### 5. No cleanup needed

`react/src/App.jsx` is never modified, so there's nothing to restore.

---

### TypeScript problems

#### 2. Copy the stub to your answers directory

```bash
cp typescript/practice_problems/problem_01_donation_processor.ts \
   typescript/practice_problem_answers/my_answer_01_donation_processor.ts
```

The prefix (`my_answer_`, `cw_answer_`, etc.) can be anything — the filename **must** keep the `NN_<name>` segment.

#### 3. Implement it

Fill in the `throw new Error('Not implemented')` stubs. Keep the class and method signatures identical to the stub.

#### 4. Run tests against your answer

```bash
# Via run_tests.sh (from repo root)
./run_tests.sh \
  -f typescript/practice_problem_answers/my_answer_01_donation_processor.ts \
  -c npm run test:01

# Or directly from typescript/ with the env var
cd typescript
PRACTICE_ANSWER=my_answer_01_donation_processor npm run test:01

# Watch mode (re-runs on every save)
PRACTICE_ANSWER=my_answer_01_donation_processor npm run test:watch
```

The `PRACTICE_ANSWER` env var tells Jest to redirect imports of the stub to your answer file — you never need to edit the test files.

---

### Go problems

#### 2. Copy the stub to your answers directory

```bash
cp golang/practice_problems/problem_01_geofence_alert_engine/problem.go \
   golang/practice_problem_answers/my_answer_01_geofence_alert_engine.go
```

The prefix can be anything; the `NN_<name>` segment must match the problem directory name.

#### 3. Implement it

Replace every `panic("not implemented")` with a real implementation. Your answer file must:
- Declare the same package name as the problem (shown at the top of `problem.go`, e.g. `package geofence`)
- Only import standard-library packages
- Include the type definitions copied from `problem.go` (keep them as-is)

#### 4. Run tests against your answer

```bash
# Full test suite
./run_tests.sh \
  -f golang/practice_problem_answers/my_answer_01_geofence_alert_engine.go \
  -c go test -v .

# Single test group
./run_tests.sh \
  -f golang/practice_problem_answers/my_answer_01_geofence_alert_engine.go \
  -c go test -v -run TestIsInZone .
```

`run_tests.sh` automatically pairs your answer file with the right `problem_test.go`, compiles them together in a temporary directory, and runs the tests — no `go.mod` setup required.

## Adding new problems with an AI agent
⚠️ WARNING - PLEASE READ: If contributing, please do not add any problems verbatim from actual technical interviews. We don't want to get each other in trouble or cause issues for people actively interviewing. The `AGENTS.md` file has instructions to scrub actual company names from problems, but please double check the code for that before submitting a PR.

This repo is designed to be extended with Codex. Open Codex in this repo and describe what you want. Codex automatically discovers the repository-wide `AGENTS.md` and augments it with the `AGENTS.md` in the relevant language directory. Claude Code remains supported through the small `CLAUDE.md` compatibility files, which point to the canonical `AGENTS.md` guidance without duplicating it.

A good prompt specifies: the language, the industry/domain, the core data structure or algorithm pattern, the number of parts, and any constraints on problem style. Example:

```
Generate a new Senior SWE interview problem for the python/ directory.

- Domain: dev-tools / CI-CD infrastructure
- Core concept: a class-based job scheduler that manages a queue of build jobs
  with priorities, dependencies between jobs, and cancellation
- 3 progressive parts: Part 1 basic enqueue/dequeue, Part 2 job dependencies
  (a job can't start until its dependencies complete), Part 3 priority ordering
  within the ready queue
- Style: class-based, candidate chooses internal data structures
- Follow all conventions in AGENTS.md (fixtures, no class-level state,
  self-contained parts, composing methods, concrete usage example in docstring)
- [optional] - please checkout this JD/company website, do some research on the company
   to see if the company asks a specific style of interview questions and base the practice 
   problem(s) off of that.

After creating the problem and test files, add an entry to the PROBLEMS array
in data.js following the format in AGENTS.md.
```

The agent will create:
- `python/practice_problems/problem_NN_<name>.py` — the stub
- `python/tests/test_problem_NN_<name>.py` — the test suite
- An entry in the `PROBLEMS` array in `data.js`

DO NOT ask it to improve existing problems or test suites, unless you don't plan to merge your branch into `main`
as that will likely break other peoples' answers. Instead, if you would like to improve upon an existing problem/test
just copy and paste it into a new problem/test file with something like `v.x` appended to the file name, and then try
to improve the problem and/or test suite.
